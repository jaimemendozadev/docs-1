# Auth0 Identity Labs

Welcome to the home for Auth0's digital identity labs! These exercises serve as a learning tool to be combined with our [Learn Identity video series](/videos/learn-identity). Each lab is meant to be completed once a video (or series of videos) is complete.

A few general things to keep in mind as you work through these labs:

- Plan to take around 1 hour or so (longer depending on your coding experience) for each lab.
- These labs are designed to illustrate the basic concepts of digital identity, OAuth, and OpenID Connect. The goal is to see the parameters and data that come together to create a complete authentication flow. As such, take your time and read through each section carefully. Completing the lab successfully is less important than understanding the concepts within.
- Because the purpose of these labs is instruction, the code samples here should **not** be used as-is in a production app. For guidance on integrating Auth0 with a new or existing app, please see the Quickstarts listed on our [documentation home page](/) (choose an application type, then the technology you're using).
- Each lab will have a list of pre-requisites to complete or install. Please take note of specific version numbers as these can have an effect on how the labs work.
- The error messages displayed in the browser and in the console can often clue you into something that is going wrong. Auth0 error pages typically include a link under the "Technical Details" header that will give you more information about what went wrong. A "SyntaxError" line in your terminal window when starting the server indicates a typo or missed line.
- The code samples may include a grayed-out line of code to indicate where the next snippet should go. In most cases, the order of operations (as in, when a particular line of code runs) matter greatly so pay attention to those lines and the description above each snippet.
- Terminal commands are proceeded by a `❯` character. If you're copying those commands, exclude that character and the space that follows. Exclude all lines that do not start with `❯`, those are there to show the expected output.

And with that, let's get started!
